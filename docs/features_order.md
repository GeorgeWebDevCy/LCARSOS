# LCARS OS Feature Build Order

This document outlines the recommended order for implementing the major LCARS OS features. Each section briefly describes the feature and the basic steps to integrate it into the application.

## 1. LCARS Panel Layout & Rounded Buttons
- Establish a flexible panel layout using CSS Flexbox or Grid.
- Create reusable button styles with asymmetric rounded corners.
- Support vertical and horizontal panel orientations.

## 2. Theme Engine & Dynamic Font Loading
- Define CSS variables for colors and fonts.
- Implement a simple theme switcher that toggles CSS variables at runtime.
- Load LCARS-style fonts dynamically from Google Fonts or local assets.

## 3. System Status Panel
- Use Node's `os` module to gather CPU, memory, and storage data.
- Display this information in a dedicated panel with LCARS-styled graphs or bars.
- Update the stats at regular intervals to keep the panel live.

## 4. Plugin/Extension Support
- Create a `plugins/` directory where JavaScript modules can be loaded dynamically.
- Expose a registration API in `renderer.js` so plugins can add buttons or panels.
- Example plugin ideas: weather widget, mini games, smart home controller.

## 5. Additional Enhancements
- Audio feedback for buttons and alerts.
- Ambient bridge sounds or voice feedback.
- Hotkeys, gestures, and kiosk mode options.

Use this roadmap as a starting point for development. Tackle each feature sequentially to build a solid LCARS-inspired interface.
