# LCARS OS Feature Build Order

This document outlines the recommended order for implementing the major LCARS OS features. Each section briefly describes the feature and the basic steps to integrate it into the application.

## 1. LCARS Panel Layout & Rounded Buttons
- Establish a flexible panel layout using CSS Flexbox or Grid.
- Create reusable button styles with asymmetric rounded corners.
- Support vertical and horizontal panel orientations.

## 2. Theme Engine & Dynamic Font Loading
- Define CSS variables for colors and fonts.
- Implement a simple theme switcher that toggles CSS variables at runtime.
- Load LCARS-style fonts dynamically from Google Fonts or local assets.

## 3. System Status Panel
- Use Node's `os` module to gather CPU, memory, and storage data.
- Display this information in a dedicated panel with LCARS-styled graphs or bars.
- Update the stats at regular intervals to keep the panel live.

## 4. Plugin/Extension Support
- Create a `plugins/` directory where JavaScript modules can be loaded dynamically.
- Expose a registration API in `renderer.js` so plugins can add buttons or panels.
- Example plugin ideas: weather widget, mini games, smart home controller.

## 5. Additional Enhancements
- Audio feedback for buttons and alerts.
- Ambient bridge sounds or voice feedback.
- Hotkeys, gestures, and kiosk mode options.

## 6. Weather Plugin & Ambient Sound
- Implement a plugin that fetches weather data from a free API and displays it in the interface.
- Add an ambient "hum" toggle with a persistent oscillator for background atmosphere.
- Include a keyboard shortcut (Ctrl+Shift+T) to toggle themes quickly.

## 7. Starship Status Simulator
- Create a plugin that displays fictional ship metrics like warp core output.
- Randomize values and update them periodically for a lively display.

## 8. Fullscreen Toggle
- Add a button and <kbd>F11</kbd> hotkey to switch between fullscreen and windowed mode.

## 9. Scanner and Transmission
- Implement a forward scanner overlay for dramatic scans.
- Create a transmission screen showing incoming messages.

## 10. 3D Planet View
- Display a rotating 3D planet using Three.js for added flair.

Use this roadmap as a starting point for development. Tackle each feature sequentially to build a solid LCARS-inspired interface.
