# Additional Features from louh/lcars

This project integrates several ideas from the [louh/lcars](https://github.com/louh/lcars) repository.
Below is a short overview of the imported concepts:

- **Forward Scanner animation** – a CSS animation that mimics the scanning brackets.
- **Incoming Transmission screen** – displays the Starfleet logo and message.
- **3D Planet View** – renders a rotating planet model using Three.js.

These features were adapted into plugins so they can be toggled from the LCARS sidebar.
